Question:
Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and non-negative integer value representing a key, write a function that returns a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet, where k is the key.
Note that letters should “wrap” around the alphabet; in other words, the letter “z” shifted by 1 returns the letter “a”.

Sample Input: “xyz”, 2
Sample Output: “zab”
